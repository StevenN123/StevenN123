Steven Portfolio

I like to code. I code in the morning, I code in the afternoon, but I like to code more at night. The werewolves don't come at night when I code; my superpower grows, and as Naruto helps me, my code becomes powerful like a lightsaber. Gundam robots come out of my code as I solve the mysteries of algorithms, dungeons, and dragons.
